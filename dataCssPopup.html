<p>If you’re writing your HTML and CSS code in OOCSS-style, Yandex’s BEM style
specifically, you will like this filter.It provides some aliases and automatic 
insertions of common block and element names in classes.</p>
<p>In short, BEM introduces three concept types for CSS classes: Block, 
Element and Modifier. Block is a some sort of a namespace for a semantic 
sections of HTML page, for example, search-form.Element is a part of section, 
for example, serch-form__query-string.Modifiers define variations of block 
and elements: search-form_wide or search-form_narrow. Elements in class names
 are separated with __ (double underscore) and modifiers are separated with _ 
(single underscore). </p>
<p> While BEM/OOCSS is a great way to maintain and re-use CSS,it may be very
tedious to write these class names in plain HTML, even with help of Emmet 
abbreviations.You have to write the same block or element name in every element 
of abbreviation.</p>
